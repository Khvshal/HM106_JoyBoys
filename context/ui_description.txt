Good, now we’re in **system-design + UX narration mode**, which is exactly what judges test mentally when you present.
I’ll be **very explicit and sequential**, like a user walkthrough. No hand-waving.

I’ll answer in **two parts**:

1. **How news/articles enter your platform (your doubt)**
2. **Exact UI flow: click-by-click, screen-by-screen**

---

# PART 1 — HOW DOES YOUR PLATFORM GET NEWS? (CLEAR THE CONFUSION)

You are **NOT Reddit-only** and **NOT scraper-only**.

👉 **You use a HYBRID INGESTION MODEL**
This is important. It makes your platform feel alive and credible.

## Your platform has TWO entry paths for articles:

### 🔹 A. System-Aggregated Articles (Primary)

* Backend periodically scrapes:

  * Trusted RSS feeds (BBC, Reuters, etc.)
* For each article:

  * A post is auto-created in your system
  * Initial credibility = neutral / under review
* Users then:

  * View
  * Rate
  * Comment
  * Report

This ensures:

* Fresh content
* No empty platform problem

---

### 🔹 B. User-Submitted Articles (Secondary)

* User clicks **“Submit Article”**
* Pastes URL
* System:

  * Extracts content
  * Checks if article already exists
  * If new → creates a post
  * Marks as “User Submitted”

This gives:

* Community involvement
* Coverage beyond your scraped sources

🔴 **Important rule:**
User-submitted ≠ trusted by default → starts at *Under Review*

---

### 🔑 Judge-friendly explanation (memorize this):

> “Our platform combines automated aggregation for coverage and user submissions for diversity, while applying the same credibility pipeline to both.”

That sentence alone is gold.

---

# PART 2 — UI / UX FLOW (CLICK-BY-CLICK, NO AMBIGUITY)

I’ll walk through this as if I’m a **first-time user**.

---

## 🟦 1. LANDING PAGE (Unauthenticated)

### What the user sees:

* Top navbar:

  * Logo
  * Login / Sign Up
* Main feed:

  * List of news cards

### Each news card shows:

* Headline
* Source name + source credibility badge
* Credibility score (color-coded)
* Credibility status badge (🟡🟢🔴)
* “View Analysis” button

📌 **User action:** clicks **“View Analysis”**

---

## 🟦 2. ARTICLE DETAIL PAGE (Core Screen)

This is your **most important UI**.

### Top section:

* Article headline
* Source info (clickable → source profile)
* Overall credibility score
* Status badge (e.g., Under Review)

Buttons:

* 👍 Rate Credibility
* 🚩 Report Issue
* 💬 View Comments

---

### 🟨 Credibility Breakdown Section

Displayed immediately (no scrolling):

* Pie chart showing:

  * Source trust
  * Community score
  * NLP analysis
  * Cross-source support
* Tooltip on hover: explains each slice

📌 **User clicks on a slice** → sees explanation text

---

### 🟨 Cross-Source Verification Section

Below breakdown:

* Text:

  > “This claim is supported by 3 independent sources”
* List:

  * Source name
  * Link
  * Source credibility score

📌 **User clicks a source** → opens that article in new tab

---

### 🟨 NLP Highlighted Article Body

Article text shown with:

* 🔴 Red highlights → emotional / sensational language
* 🟢 Green highlights → factual statements

Legend shown on side.

📌 **User scrolls → visually understands bias**

---

## 🟦 3. USER INTERACTION FLOW

### 🟩 Rating Flow

User clicks **“Rate Credibility”**:

Modal opens:

* Slider (Low → High credibility)
* Dropdown:

  * Reason (poor sourcing, emotional tone, etc.)
* Submit button

System:

* Applies weighted vote
* Updates score (unless soft-locked)

---

### 🟩 Commenting Flow

User clicks **“View Comments”**:

* Comment list (sorted by user credibility)
* “Add Comment” button

Add Comment modal:

* Reason tag (required)
* Optional explanation

This avoids garbage comments.

---

### 🟩 Reporting Flow

User clicks **“Report Issue”**:

Modal:

* Select issue type
* Optional note
* Submit

System:

* Triggers review logic
* Affects reporter credibility later

---

## 🟦 4. CREDIBILITY STATUS & LOCK UI

If spam detected:

Banner appears at top:

> ⚠️ Credibility under verification due to unusual activity.

Effects:

* Score frozen
* Rating disabled
* Explanation visible

This **builds trust**, not frustration.

---

## 🟦 5. USER PROFILE PAGE

User clicks profile icon:

### Shows:

* Overall credibility level
* Category-wise credibility (finance, geopolitics, etc.)
* Voting history summary
* Reports made vs upheld

This discourages abuse.

---

## 🟦 6. SOURCE PROFILE PAGE

Clicking a source name opens:

* Source credibility score
* Historical trend graph
* Articles published
* Report frequency

Very few teams build this. Huge edge.

---

## 🟦 7. ADMIN DASHBOARD (Restricted)

Admin sees:

* Flagged articles
* Suspicious users
* Spike detection alerts

Admin actions:

* Soft lock / unlock article
* Adjust source score
* Override credibility (with justification)

All actions logged.

---

# FINAL CLARITY (IMPORTANT)

Your platform flow is:

```
News enters system
→ Initial neutral credibility
→ Users interact (weighted)
→ AI analyzes language
→ Cross-source verification runs
→ Credibility evolves transparently
```

Not Reddit.
Not Google News.
A **credibility layer on top of news**.

---

## HARD TRUTH

If you **demo this flow smoothly**, judges won’t question your backend depth — they’ll *assume it exists*.

Bad UI kills good ideas.
Clear UI **amplifies** average tech.

If you want next, I can:

* Turn this into a **UI wireframe outline**
* Help you decide **which screens to build first**
* Write a **demo narration script**

Choose one.
