Backend API (Auth + Core Logic)

Background Workers (Scraping / Analysis)

Key architectural decisions (WHY this scores points)

Frontend ≠ Backend → clean separation (scalability + maintainability)

Credibility Engine is modular → new signals can be added later

Background jobs → scraping & NLP don’t block users

Cache scores → fast UI, scalable reads
